# Pre-release docs for creating JavaScript actions

I recommend reading the docs in this order:
1. [Understanding the model](actions-model.md)
2. [Write a hello-world](javascript-walkthrough.md)
3. [Consume actions in a workflow](workflow.md)
4. [Refer to metadata as needed](metadata.md)

_Note: these are all ported from other repos, and may have dangling links._
