# Pre-release docs for creating JavaScript actions

I recommend reading the docs in this order:
1. [Understanding the model](actions-model.md)
2. [Write a hello-world](javascript-walkthrough.md) (also note: for first party actions, we recommend starting from https://github.com/actions/node12-template instead of a fresh repo - it preconfigures lots of stuff for you)
3. [Test using DevFabric](testing-with-devfabric.md)
4. [Consume actions in a workflow](workflow.md)
5. [Refer to metadata as needed](metadata.md)

_Note: these are all ported from other repos, and may have dangling links._
